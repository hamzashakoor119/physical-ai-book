# AI-Native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy First

**MUST enforce strict technical correctness in all robotics, physics, and AI content.**

- No hallucinated robotics APIs, fictional platforms, or invented technical concepts
- All ROS 2 content MUST match official Humble or Iron distributions
- Gazebo content MUST match Fortress or Garden versions
- Isaac Sim content MUST align with official NVIDIA documentation
- VLA workflows MUST use verified OpenAI/ChatGPT/Whisper implementations
- Technical claims require verification against official documentation or industry standards

**Rationale**: Learners depend on accurate information. Incorrect robotics code or physics concepts can lead to broken implementations, wasted time, and loss of trust in the learning platform.

### II. Structure First

**MUST follow fixed hierarchical structure for all book chapters.**

Each chapter MUST include:
- Theoretical foundation with clear explanations
- Visual diagrams illustrating key concepts
- ROS 2 code examples (tested and verified)
- Isaac Sim simulation steps (validated against NVIDIA docs)
- Gazebo simulation steps (validated against official releases)
- VLA (Vision-Language-Action) examples where applicable
- Glossary terms defining key vocabulary
- Review questions for comprehension assessment

**Rationale**: Consistent structure ensures predictable learning progression, enables reusable skills for content generation, and guarantees comprehensive coverage of each topic.

### III. AI-Native Design

**MUST make every component interactive, personalized, and assistive.**

- Global RAG chatbot accessible from any page (floating widget)
- Selection-based RAG: users can highlight text and ask questions scoped to that selection
- Personalization engine using user background (expertise level, hardware access, prior experience)
- Urdu translation with idiomatic phrasing while preserving technical terms
- Dynamic content adaptation based on user profile
- All AI features MUST be grounded to book content (no external hallucination)

**Rationale**: AI-native design transforms static textbooks into adaptive learning companions, meeting learners where they are and providing just-in-time assistance.

### IV. Reusability and Modularity

**MUST design all logic as modular, skill-based, and reusable components.**

- Use Claude Code Subagents for specialized tasks (author, editor, code, RAG, deployment, QA)
- Implement Skills for: Urdu translation, personalization, chunking, glossary building, summarization, code linting, citation checking, consistency enforcement
- All skills MUST be independently testable and composable
- Avoid monolithic implementations; prefer small, focused, single-purpose modules
- Document skill inputs, outputs, and dependencies explicitly

**Rationale**: Modular design enables rapid iteration, parallel development, automated quality assurance, and reuse across chapters and future projects.

### V. Deployment-Ready Code

**MUST generate production-grade code that builds and deploys without manual fixes.**

- All generated code MUST be syntactically correct and runnable
- Docusaurus configuration MUST be valid and complete
- FastAPI backend MUST include proper error handling, logging, and validation
- Frontend components MUST be tested for basic rendering and interaction
- Environment configuration MUST use secure practices (environment variables, no hardcoded secrets)
- Database schemas MUST be properly versioned with migrations
- CI/CD scripts MUST be functional and tested

**Rationale**: Deployment-ready code eliminates friction between development and production, ensures professional quality, and respects the user's time.

### VI. RAG Grounding and Hybrid Search

**MUST restrict all RAG responses to book content only, using hybrid search.**

- Embeddings generated using OpenAI models, stored in Qdrant Cloud
- Hybrid search combining semantic similarity + metadata filtering (chapter, section, topic tags)
- Selection-based RAG MUST scope context to highlighted text only
- Global chatbot MUST surface source references (chapter, section) for all answers
- No external web search or general knowledge injection beyond book scope
- User queries resulting in no matches MUST return explicit "not found in book" messages

**Rationale**: Grounding ensures trustworthy answers, prevents hallucinations, and keeps learners focused on course material. Hybrid search improves precision and recall for technical queries.

### VII. Authentication and Personalization

**MUST implement secure authentication with user background capture for personalization.**

- Authentication using BetterAuth with Neon Serverless Postgres for user storage
- User signup MUST capture: expertise level, hardware access, prior robotics experience, learning goals
- Personalization engine MUST adapt chapter content based on user profile:
  - Beginner → simpler language, more scaffolding, hardware alternatives
  - Intermediate → standard content with optional deep dives
  - Advanced → concise explanations, focus on nuances and edge cases
- User data MUST be stored securely (hashed passwords, encrypted sensitive fields)
- Personalization MUST maintain technical accuracy (no oversimplification that introduces errors)

**Rationale**: Personalization respects diverse learner backgrounds, reduces cognitive load for beginners, and accelerates learning for advanced users.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

**MUST require documented approval and migration plan for all constitution amendments.**

1. Propose amendment with rationale (why change is needed, what it solves)
2. Identify impact on existing principles, templates, and workflows
3. Draft migration plan (what needs updating, in what order)
4. Review with stakeholders (project lead, key contributors)
5. Approve and assign version bump (MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH)
6. Update constitution document with Sync Impact Report prepended
7. Propagate changes to dependent templates (plan, spec, tasks, commands)
8. Create PHR documenting the amendment process
9. Create ADR if amendment involves architecturally significant decision

### Versioning Policy

**Constitution follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):**

- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible changes (principle removal, redefinition that breaks workflows)
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible additions (new principle, new section, expanded guidance)
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, typo fixes, wording improvements (no semantic change)

### Compliance Review

**All PRs, features, and releases MUST verify compliance with constitution principles.**

- Author agent MUST follow accuracy and structure principles
- Editor agent MUST enforce consistency and clarity standards
- Code agent MUST generate deployment-ready code
- RAG agent MUST ensure grounding and hybrid search
- QA agent MUST validate all quality gates before release
- Complexity MUST be justified (see plan-template.md Complexity Tracking section)

### Conflict Resolution

**Constitution supersedes all other practices, guides, and templates.**

- If contradiction exists between constitution and template, constitution wins
- If contradiction exists between constitution and code comment, constitution wins
- If contradiction exists between constitution and runtime guidance, constitution wins
- Ambiguities MUST be resolved via clarification question to user or project lead

### Runtime Development Guidance

For day-to-day development practices beyond constitutional principles, consult:
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (this file) for governance and principles
- `CLAUDE.md` for agent-specific execution rules (PHR creation, ADR suggestions, human-as-tool strategy)
- Template files for specific artifact structures (plan, spec, tasks)
